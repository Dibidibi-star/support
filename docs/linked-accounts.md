# What are Linked Accounts?
A linked account is when your account is 'linked' to another player or device. Both accounts attached to that device end up being punished if found guilty of violating the [NetherGames Guidelines](https://support.nethergames.org/enforcement-system).

::: info PLEASE NOTE
Sharing your account is **NOT** recommended, and will lead to both users being restricted from accessing our network if a punishment is issued. NetherGames is not responsible for who you give your account access to and is therefore not required to unlink your account.
:::

## How can I unlink my account?
It is currently not possible to unlink your account from someone else. 

## What if I need to have my account linked?
If you need to share your device or account with someone, make sure you 100% trust them before you do so, and that they will not try and break the NetherGames Guidelines. Remember! Your account is at stake to whoever you link up with.
