## Transferring the remainder of your Titan rank

You can transfer the remaining days left of your Titan rank to other players provided that you are not banned. This is outlined in our [Refund Policy](https://support.nethergames.org/refund-policy).

If your Titan rank is from an active subscription, the subscription will cancel upon transferring to another player and the recipient will be able to use the remaining paid days of the subscription. 

1. Head to [store.nethergames.org](https://store.nethergames.org).
2. Click on login button in the top-right corner and login with your Microsoft account.
3. Once you're logged in, click on your username in the top-right corner.
4. Under the "Subscriptions" category, you should see your current Titan subscription.
5. Click on the arrow button on your subscription.
6. Enter the desired recipient's username and press "Continue".

The Titan rank should be sent, and the recipient can accept the Titan rank by heading to [store.nethergames.org](https://store.nethergames.org). If you change your mind you have the opportunity to cancel the transfer before the recipient has accepted it by going to your Gift Inventory and clicking on the "X" button.
